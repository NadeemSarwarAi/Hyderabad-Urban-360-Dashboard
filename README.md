# Hyderabad Urban 360° Dashboard

### Public Policy Analytics & Cross-Sector Insights
**Tools:** Power BI | DAX | Excel | Data Modeling

---

## Project Overview
The **Hyderabad Urban 360° Dashboard** is a comprehensive analytics solution designed to provide a holistic view of urban metrics for Hyderabad's **21M+ citizens**. By integrating disparate datasets, this project models the complex relationships between infrastructure development, environmental impact, and public utility reliability.

The goal was to derive critical policy insights to aid in urban planning and risk mitigation.


## Key Insights & Findings
Based on advanced data modeling and DAX analysis, the following critical insights were uncovered:
**Power Infrastructure Analysis:** Identified **"Network Expansion"** as the primary cause of power interruptions, accounting for **2,000+ outage hours**. This highlights a correlation between rapid urbanization and utility stability.
**Environmental Risk Assessment:** Modeled air quality data to reveal a **98% air quality risk** for the urban population, signalling an urgent need for pollution control policy intervention.
**Cross-Sector Correlations:** Utilized DAX to model relationships between distinct sectors, providing a 360-degree view of how infrastructure growth impacts daily citizen life.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
**Power BI:** Used for the primary visualization interface and interactive reporting.
**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Implemented complex measures to calculate risk percentages and aggregate outage hours across different time frames[cite: 35].
**Data Modeling:** Created a star schema to link cross-sector datasets (Environment, Power, Demographics) for unified analysis.
**Excel:** Used for initial data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Data Structure
The analysis focuses on the following key metrics:
1.  **Air Quality Index (AQI):** Historical trends and risk categorization.
2.  **Power Supply Data:** Outage duration, frequency, and categorization (e.g., Breakdown vs. Expansion).
3.  **Demographics:** Population density mapping for Hyderabad.
